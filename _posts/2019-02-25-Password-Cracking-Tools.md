**Passwords** 

What do we need to understand about passwords? We kind of use passwords on a daily basis, on our operating systems, our social media, and so on, we are quite reliant on them enough that I believe we should understand how important it is to protect our passwords. So, what are Password Crackers, the main purpose of password cracking is to help a user in recovering forgotten passwords, it could also be used in other cases such as digital evidence, but it is also known in involving giving System Administration privileges to gain unauthorised access to a system.


**Password tools**

What is Pasword Cracking? Is it important? Well, cracking software programs such as John the Ripper and Hashcat are designed in various ways to decrypt passwords that can be vulnerable to a dictionary attack by looking for pattern in checking against an available cryptographic hash. A common approach that is well known within the security industry known as a brute force attack which essentially boils down to repeatedly trying different guess to crack encrypted data. This is mainly known for brute force attacks which includes dictionary attacks using rockyou or wordlist, predetermined words and substitution of characters and numbers are used to check through cryptographic patterns. There are many other tools such as Medusa, Hydra that the attacker can use to mitigate damage to the victim. 


**John the Ripper** 

John the Ripper is a free password cracking software tool that was initially developed for the UNIX operating system which is now cross-platform released in 1996. There are many factors that affect how the tool can attack, how well a user constructs their password, does the password have any relation to their personal influence, the user’s birthday or it might be their dog’s name. Well, the time for cracking password is related to the password strength as this plays a major role of effectiveness of a password so users should invest in the functions of the password’s length, complexity and unpredictability. John the Ripper can decrypt many hashes such as Blowfish, DES and MD-5 and other additional modules such as MD-4, so it is suggested that security professionals be concerned when against John the Ripper.


**Hash Cat** 

Similar to John the Ripper, Hash Cat has similar functions by using a wordlist to figure out the password. There are different attacks that hashcat can use such as thhe typical brute-force attack, a combinator attack, dictionary attack, mask attack, rule-based attack and a toggle-case attack. These all have different ways for the attacker to attack the victim. The rule based attack uses a certain set of rules, this makes the attack more easiler to figure out the solution to the hash by making it simplier for the attack such as making it case sensitive. 

**Effects and Impacts**

There are different purposes of using a password cracking tool, however attacks uses these tools to gain unauthorised access to admin or the user's account and gain privilages and access to information data. The stakeholers of business can be affected as these tools are available on the web and can be used in various ways to figure out passwords and overall disrupting the business applications when someone has root access. The development of a Two-factor authentication (2FA), one-time password, increasing the password length, different encryption methods, and using stronger passwords with different words/characters that are complex are ways to make it more difficult for the attacker to crack the password.
