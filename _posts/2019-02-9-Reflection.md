Introduction

Being involved with many of CSEC events and having the opportunity to participate in CSYCA competition inspired my ambition to be involved in the studio subject and achieving its objective.

Learning Contract
What do you intend to achieve through the project, including learning goals and tasks to be completed?

With the guidance of my tutors, I sincerely anticipate a clearly understanding of the field for further investment. These learning goals also include enhancing my skills in web pen-testing, reverse engineering, forensics and public speaking. 
What will be your contribution to the group effort?

My contribution to the group effect would be collaborating with other members of the studio, communicating with fellow peers.

What will you learn in that process?

I learnt during this week, I need to become a better public speaker, poison ivy and other RAT (Remote Access Trojans), revised by Jason’s group on bug bounties and a requirement for improving my understanding of exploits and vulnerabilities.

What will you produce?

I will produce a static website, an encapsulation of understanding many vulnerabilities and exploits, improved communication skills and developed skills in hacking.

What Have we Learned?

What was essentially learnt during this week were needing to better communicate with the group in both professional level and social level. This is accentuated via my weak co-ordination in the presentation. 

What do we need to Learn? 
We also need to understand each other’s weaknesses such as the flaws in my public speaking abilities and integrate me into a position well suited, so I can engage the audience with stronger interactions. 

What do we need to do NEXT? 
collectively – both students and staff

The members of my group are currently achieving their goals, I however need to improve in my public speaking abilities and engage in more conversations and increase my involvement.Even though Darsh and Larry are great tutors and mentors but since I’m one of the weaker students within the studio, I continue to hope they both continue to contribute to my knowledge and skills in the cyber industry. I also hope to able to use Darsh, Larry, Cameron or Mitchel as a resource to build my confidence.

What was the feedback I recieved?

The recent feedback recieved mentios that I need to engage with the stakeholder according to Larry such as the audience with eye contact rather than looking down. I would assume that there isn’t an issue in this area as I have a clear understanding of how to develop my understanding in solving problems. Another requirement is to further develop an understanding of technical skill that I don’t know such as learning about vulnerabilities and how to replicate them. 

What did I do with the feedback I recieved? 

I hope that with more preparation with my public speaking abilities, in a way that the audience would still understand my speech. I hope to gain a better understanding of vulnerabilities and exploits via research. With this feedback, I hope to continue to engage in discussing security flaws with my team members.
