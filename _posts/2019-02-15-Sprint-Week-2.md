Reflective Statement 

Throughout the week, spent three days fixing my websites through configurating netify, Luke's presentation and Friday's presentation further inspired in my current development of how XSS works, PentesterLab, OvertheWire, rootme, OWASP

I have witten notes on PentesterLab BootCamp, based on linux, HTTP, PHP, DNS, SQL as another way in futher improving web attacks and increasing my workflow and contribution in passing this subject. OverTheWire played a major challenge as I had to recomplete many of the challenges that I had completed the previous year which refreshed my understading of many web attack methods e.g command injection. The free-for-all and the Research Task werer great opportunities for collaboration and communication as I understood how Andy's use of OWASP zap to create reports on click jacking and Cameron's use of bug bounty websites illustrate conprehensive ambitions for find vulnerabilities and exploits. Furthermore, this contributed us gathering ideas and inspiring each other with different approaches in doing the friday task and improving our portfolio. 

What was the feedback I recieved?

The constructive feedback recieved by Larry throughout the past two weeks indicated through my flaws in public speaking as accentuated a requirement for more confident in my body language, less fiddling, no pauses when speaking, and more direct eye contract and focus on the audience when presenting to stakeholders and classmates. Other disappointing development were the intensive technical details that were presented, However, I have to admitt that I was confused on what the questions for friday task was asking. It was stated by Larry through our discussion that my technical skills weren't as necessary for the values of major stakeholders (SLO 1).

What did I do with the feedback I received?
The feedback that I recieved will be used to improve my portfolio, further improve my public speaking issues and my presentation issues to achieve the SLO outcomes hopefully in the following weeks. Should had and will ask anyone in the studio for guidance, both tutors and students when in need of assistence. Time management is annother issues as I need o effective evaluate where to usemy time effectively in response to the massive work load that is accumulating each week. To address many of my problem, I distinctly recommend that I be more open and ask more questions when requiring assistence.
Hence, currently inflicted this week due to being flawed with high expectations but a low output displaying my skills in displaying my knowledge of the cyber field.
