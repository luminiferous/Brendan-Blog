* **Sprint Reflection**
The final week was reverse engineering, apply our skills and knowledge to demonstrate to stakeholders, achieving root access on a Hack the Box machine and documenting the report and the process. This also tested how well we progressed throughout the four weeks as we gained insight and to further involve the continuation of the previous task in exploiting vulnerable machines. Other important features include documenting my HTB challenges through a given format and continuing learning other exploits.

The focus on presenting to other studios and reverse engineering with Ruben T. was significant with the presentation by intensely developing my understanding through the reversing, how the functions operate and how the commands in gdb functions.
On Monday, I completed two challenges on reverse engineering and learnt the basics of reversing systems and understanding how the system functions to figure out the flags. With reverse engineering. I was able to attempt the first three challenges and managed to find the flag for each. This was through Ruben .T's providing a walk-through that help my first comprehension of the topic and to understand the basics of reversing programs. By using PEDA GNU debugger tool, and setting break points, understanding assembly language, setting a break point and copying an address from a location that had the secret number, this gave a hexadecimal that when input into the program gave the flag. 

With HELP HTB, my attempt to understand the box proved quite challenging as I couldn't figure out the vulnerabilities on the machine. I tired uploading a PHP script that would give me remote access but couldn't figure out how to get the script to run. This was problematic as I tried other ways to figure out how would I get root access to the machine. I was however able to complete a retired box having both root access and user access on HTB Lame.

The presentation to the students of other studios also involved accentuating a major impact in my learning as to become a security professional, engaging and communicating with stakeholders is key to elaborate and circulate ideas and showing a demo of a HTB challenge further generated personal insight.


**Feedback** 
The feedback from Darsh (tutor) indicated that I was on the right path, continuing to do more CTF challenges and HTB challenges would further increase my understanding of the topics that were learnt throughout the weeks. I also attempted to use the feedback from the previous week as motivation for my development in public speaking to the fellow peers that didn't have knowledge of how to break into a machine.
