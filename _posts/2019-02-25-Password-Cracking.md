**Passwords** 
What do we need to understand about passwords? We kind of use passwords on a daily basis, on our operating systems, our social media, and so on, we are quite reliant on them enough that I believe we should understand how important it is to protect our passwords. So, what are Password Crackers, the main purpose of password cracking is to help a user in recovering forgotten passwords, it could also be used in other cases such as digital evidence, but it is also known in involving giving System Administration privileges to gain unauthorised access to a system.
Well, cracking software programs such as John the Ripper and Hashcat are designed in various ways to decrypt passwords that can be vulnerable to a dictionary attack by looking for pattern in checking against an available cryptographic hash. A common approach that is well known within the security industry known as a brute force attack which essentially boils down to repeatedly trying different guess to crack encrypted data.
