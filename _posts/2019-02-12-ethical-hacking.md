How ethical hacking and bug bounties are impacting stakeholders?

Bug Bounties 

A reward offered to a person who identifies and reports an error, vulnerability or an exploit in a computer program, applications. 
This would include understanding the flaw, and reiterating the setps to reproduce the vulnerability/exploit.These programs are managed by companies as hackerone and major sponsors of bug bounty programs could include uses of major companies such as Facebook, GitHub, Microsoft, United Airlines. Usually, these programs resolve bugs before the general public is aware of them, preventing widespread incidents and ethical hackers or other external parties reach for the right individuals. This is a way to help improve the red teaming capabilities of the community and allows a contribution to white hat hackers. Supported by security experts and provides a way for the community to be involved in the field, these are managed by a panel of volunteers and their contribution to internet security. There are also small incentives for the community to report exploits and vulnerabilities to companies. Since all technology contains bugs and can be exploited by unethnical hackersas, rewards are given based on the impact of the flaw CVSS (Common ulnerability Scoring Standard) as mention in a recent program (Aeternity). Stakeholders that are affected by bug bounty programs include customers when reporting a bug that involved their confidental information, administrator of the company when a major exploit is patched in their application. Bug bounties solve issues that arises and keeps the business applications intact, the sense that businesses need their stakeholders to be safe and secure from bugs that could have masssive risks when user data, credentials or the company could be at stake when a hacker does a cyber attack.

How you can implement thigs you're learnt throughout the week to test web apps under a responsible disclosure program?

The vulnerability disclosure model is a policy by a disclosure only after a peroid of time that allows for the vulnerability to be patched. This is implemented by develoing enthical practices when searching for security breaches. Hence, there needs to be a process that clarifies the vulnerability and the process to the team. This can be through using hacking tools such as nmap probably to not be caught, when finding a vulnerabilities to not exploit it without permission and not to access, destroy meta data or take credentials. Other implications are not exposing the vulnerability to the public and ensuring that I report my findings by reiterating the instructions to recreate the vulnerability and figure out possible solutions to overcome the solution. This is also to ensure that I don't view the source or write ups of the vulnerability when I find it, there will be more care and concerns on the information based on what exploits affect the vulnerability and ensuring that I only report it to the company itself, hence, its important to understand the implication and consequences that will occur if I were to disclose the information on the web etc.
