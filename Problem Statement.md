**Problem Statement**

How important is Cyber Security and how important is it to cover vulnerabilities in a machine? Do we need to significantly protect our business stakeholders? As businesses are rather more considered of monetary gain rather than the security of their systems, thus is further shown in software developing communities to focus on the function of the code rather than both the code and ways for attackers to find exploits. Security for web application is significant in protecting the reputation and value of a company whether its the stakeholders or the shareholders of a company. The innovation by hackers using simple techniques for example XSS, command Injection in various other methods of attack can overall cause major damage when accessing administrative content. The incentive in our modern situation for cyber security has never been greater as there are an even ambitous incentive for hackers to gain access to a companys cooperation. Hence, there needs to be an effective way for the cyber industry to train and educate students and the community on how to deal with vulnerabilities and exploits. The problem is that I'am currently understanding the necessary how to use hacking tools such as burp suite and whireshark to effectively finding vulnerabilities and exploits in many applications. I recently had a refresh on the XSS, stored, reflected and DOM (Document Object Model) attacks and their capabilities. A such, I could evaluate that it is important to also learn both client side and server side attacks and hows theses attacks infect the victim. 

**Website Vulnerabilities**

I currently mainly been using burp suite as the main tool for web suite penetration. I need to understand the procedures of Web-pen testing, needing understand how a hacker use hacking tools to break into web systems.However, this week has been understanding how to use the hacking tools used by security professionals. I need to better use of brute forces tools such as Hydra, medusa, metasploit framework, but had understand better use of other vulnerabilities including XSS and recently click jacking.


**Bussiness Applications**

The business applications, many of these hacking tools are used industry wide so as how the concepts of these tools effectively achieve penetrating of applications are significant in effectively using the tools. Security prevention in systems and software development cycle are important aspects in the cyber industry, this can prevent various damage on stakeholders when users report and find vulnerabilities and exploits on applications. Software development cycle lacks security in its applications, and should highly work on it as there are lots of vulnerability out in the world.Through the play framework, from the pentesterlab, the user was able to gain admin access. Hence, the importance of cyber is critical even old flaws through XML can be still relevent as hackers figure out more creative ways to exploit these flaws. Hence, as society continues to progress in technology such as scada in IOT, we need to develop ways of protecting our systems / machines from foriegn entities.
