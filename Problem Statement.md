Problem Statement 
Security for web application is very important to many of our lives. The 
The problem is that I'am currently understanding the necessary how to use hacking tools such as burp suite and whireshark to effectively finding vulnerabilities and exploits in many applications. I recently had a refresh on the XSS, stored, reflected and DOM (Document Object Model) attacks and their capabilities. A such, I could evaluate that it is important to also learn both client side and server side attacks and hows theses attacks infect the victim. 

Website Vulnerabilities 
 I currently mainly been using burp suite as the main tool for web suite penetration. I need to understand the procedures of Web-pen testing, needing understand how a hacker use hacking tools to break into web systems.However, this week has been understanding how to use the hacking tools used by security professionals. I need to better use of brute forces tools such as Hydra, medusa, metasploit framework, but had understand better use of other vulnerabilities including XSS and recently click jacking.
 A such, I could evaluate that it is important to also learn both client side and server side attacks and how theses attacks infect the victim. 

XML entities is a OWASP vulnerability, while doing pentesterlab I recently read up on XML entities and how poeple use it to exploit.
XML is a extensive markup language in which defines a set of encoding rules for encoding documents that is both human-readable and machinereadable. 
XML, External Entity injection, behavior exposes the application to XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks, which can be used to perform denial of service of the local system, gain unauthorized access to files on the local machine, scan remote machines, and perform denial of service of remote systems.

MalFormed XML Documents
The main standard of XML specification defines a set of principles that XML documents must follow to be considered well formed. When a document violates any of these principles, the data it contains is considered malformed. Multiple tactics will cause a malformed document, removing an ending tag, rearranging the order of elements into a nonsensical structure, introducing forbidden characters. The XML parser should stop execution once detecting a fatal error. The document should not undergo any additional processing, and the application should display an error message. USers could exploit the files an use it to exploit malicious code.

Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. The use of initial mapping and analysis of an application's attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.

Target - This tool contains detailed information about your target applications, and lets you drive the process of testing for vulnerabilities.
Proxy - This is an intercepting web proxy that operates as a man-in-the-middle between the end browser and the target web application. It lets you intercept, inspect and modify the raw traffic passing in both directions.
Scanner Professional - This is an advanced web vulnerability scanner, which can automatically crawl content and audit for numerous types of vulnerabilities.
Intruder - This is a powerful tool for carrying out automated customized attacks against web applications. It is highly configurable and can be used to perform a wide range of tasks to make your testing faster and more effective.
Repeater - This is a tool for manually manipulating and reissuing individual HTTP requests, and analyzing the application's responses.
Sequencer - This is a sophisticated tool for analyzing the quality of randomness in an application's session tokens or other important data items that are intended to be unpredictable.
Decoder - This is a useful tool for performing manual or intelligent decoding and encoding of application data.
Comparer - This is a handy utility for performing a visual "diff" between any two items of data, such as pairs of similar HTTP messages.
Extender - This lets you load Burp extensions, to extend Burp's functionality using your own or third-party code.
Clickbandit - This is a tool for generating Clickjacking attacks.
Collaborator client Professional - This is a tool for making use of Burp Collaborator during manual testing.
Mobile Assistant - This is a tool to facilitate testing of mobile apps with Burp Suite.

Wireshark is the mainly used in network protocol analysis tools. It allows deep inspection and analysis of packets from hundreds of different protocols, from the ubiquitous TCP to CSLIP. This includes built-in decryption support for many encrypted protocols and powerful filtering and display capabilities, Wireshark can help you dive deep in current activity on your network and expose attacks in real time.

How three types of XSS, stored, reflected and DOM based attacks through their procedures, impact and consequences. Further with these resources that were brought up by Luke has inc


So luke's presentation elaborated how to approache web application penetration testing demonstrated the requirements of using these tools such as nmap, wget. Sothat was interesting to understand.

Learning basic web penetration concepts and be more into detail is another aspects  
Breaking into stuff.

The business applications, many of these hacking tools are used industry wide so as how the concepts of these tools effectively achieve penetrating of applications are significant in understanding the tools. These tools are important in many business use cases as it shows the employers/skateholers how well a person can break into a system effectively when used carefully and well. Security prevention in systems and software development cycle are important aspects in the cyber industry, this can prevent various damage on stakeholders when users report and find vulnerabilities and exploits on applications. Thsoftware development cycle lacks security in its applications, and should highly work on it as there are lots of vulnerability out in the world.  
Subject Learning Outcomes includes SLO engaging with stakeholders, finding out a problem in which cybersecurity experts through these tools and understanding exploits.
SLO 3, learning on technical skills as in a refrsh on XSS, learning on administrative a
