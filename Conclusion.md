**Conclusion**

To conclude, my main goal still hasn't been reached and there are still different techniques and methodologies in solving machines and CTFS. Through the past intensive but rewarding weeks of attempting the course through perssonal interest and as a goal of becoming a security professional, I definietly believed that I suceed in some aspects of my goals, completing a retired box and penetrating different machines and web applications. Reseaching exploits and common vulnerabilities and presenting them further enhanced and deepen my knowledge of the field, learning different methods of attacks idenitified how different apporaches were used to tackle obstacles and industry presentations gave personal insight and engaging my throughts to comprehend the sophisticated roles and the nature of the field I am about to undertake. The challenges and obstacles that I would undergo were public speaking issues that were present during my youth, but with encouragement and feedback from the tutors I am currently attempting to further improve public speaking throughout my degree and towards the industry. Applying all my skills and knowledge in braking into machines and finding vulnnerabilities, targeting either active boxes and retired boxes from hack the box both encourage a stronger motivation in completing the subject and further using the tools and methodologies to be used professionally in the cyber field.

**Final Reflection**

Attempting the studio as an inital stepping stone to my involvement in the cyber field and applying my understanding to further elaborate on achieving my goals has both constraint my personal time and other subjects that were undertaken during the summer. However, through pursuing this career path I have learnt and experience support by both peers and tutors to hopefull involve my interest in conducting my own personal time in further achiveing completing more machine whilist both developing the skills and knowledge to continue cyber security. Furthermore, enveloping growth and skills in having the right mindset has further allowed my continuation of seeking pride in understanding techniques used in the industry. Throughout the Cyber Security Studio, I developed further knowledge of vulnerabilities in both web applications and machines, and hope to use this opportunity to engage with stakeholders in a refined and more respectable manner. Through the learning process throughout the Cyber Summer Studio Subject, I hope that I met all required SLOs needed to pass this subject.

**SLO 1) Engage with Stakeholders to Identify a Problem**

The concepts of cyber security to protect against malicious attacks, informing the fundamental concepts of security as presented throughout the subjects has provided a clear understanding of how security impacts business practices and stakeholders. Various visits of security professionals illustrated the building blocks by which the students in studio get a understanding of the how the field workss as a whole. The introduction of industry professionals, Robert Mitchell provided the studio with a presentation of a methods of attack, firewalls and various other security topics based around the development of technology. Showing us through the problem with cloud services and their vulnerabilities, bywhich there are many targetable areas allows more risk for businessess such as Amazon that rely heavily on their cloud servers. Unlike firewall which is easily defend, Robert Mitchell clearly explained the applications and the development of security as a whole. 

The problem with cyber security is its massive impacts when stakeholders are inflicted by attacks by hackers. This is represented by the RSA SecurID 60 million dollar lost when the security systems where breached. By reaseach and studying vulnerabilities I cam to a clear understanding of how security in the workforce operated and human error being a major impact for many business when uneducated on the important of cyber security. Security professionals in cyber are required to have both skills and knowledge in testing a web application or a system, understand what can I exploit and find ways to exploits vulnerabilities that are found on a machine/ web application.

The sensation of presenting to tutors, explain the RSA breach and its effects when I gave my speech showed many of my flaws and weaknesses to the studio, when reflecting, engaging with stakeholders and understanding their through process is esseintial in a business environment  in understanding how a security professional can interact to a stakeholder in terms they can understand.
When presenting the RSA SecurID breach to the studio, my attempt to give a high level perspective with the effects and improves of the tool that was used during the attack also detailed my connection to stakeholders as I was engaging in a high levvel that makes it easier to people oblivious to cyber security. The significant in understanding how to present exploits and vulnerabilitites to stakeholders in a way that encompasses the whole topic in a simplistic high level point of view will give an easier way for the community to udnerstand would prevent many attacks from happening due to human error.

The security mind  as a ethical hacker and breaking into systems and web applications when being discussed with Luke Fuehrer, demonstrate the mindset of both a blue team hacker and a red team hacker, understanding the basics in approaches as in the metaphor with the foxes and the rabbits as a framework of security. When Luke explained what XXS (Cross Site Scripting) was he drove into problems that were present in most web applications and 3rd on OWASP, as on of the most used attacks. These are issues that security engineering faced on a daily basis and are required to further expand their understanding of the field when technology further advances.

**SLO 2) Apply Design Thinking To Respond To A Defined Or Newly Identified Problem**
When considering stakeholders, ensuring that a website and a system is secured in response to future attacks is important when considering vulnerabilities and exploits. With technology consistently improving and changing, it is important to ensure that the technical workings of security develop and continue to learn the outer and inner working of systems and web applications. Reflecting on the past 4 weeks, the various exploits and exploits learn't is important for security professionals to understand and engage with a skillful accentuation of said understanding through breaking into vulnerable web applications and systems. By developing skills to respond to situations by using a cyber security mindset involves the professional to explore different solutions to solve the same problem. There are various ways for a security professional to be involved with taking advantage of security flaws and vulnerabilities through aplying their knowledge of how the actual exploit functions.

Demonstrating the importance of cyber security to stakeholders to ensure that web applications and machines are properly secure and safe from any common risk and exploit. Focusing on both web application and attacking machines as I'm still quite new to the field, with my attempt on machines on hack the box both active and retired whilist doing writeups. This will further provide a better understanding of using drib (directory buster), Burp Suite, wget, netdiscover and various other tools and improve my skills. Expanding on my current knowledge of cyber security, this subject has helped my development into the cyber security industry. By compeleting various Overthe Wire challenges, both Natas and Bandits challenges enpowered my knowledge and skills on how to use the linux kernel and how to attack web applications. This led to consistent uses of performaing XXS and SQL injections to locate vulnerabilties on machines.

When Luke discussing the details on the mindset of a ethical hacker, he distinctly said that nmap was a noisy tool and we should be careful when using it for an actual attack. This is notated by a hacker's mindset, the response of the attack to be undetected whilist attacking the correct ports of a system is important for stakeholders. This is determonstrated by various machines on vul-hub and Hack the Box when attackers attempt to gain root, a user can easily get root access when skilled and inject malicious malware or do any other malicious activities.

The machines I could practice were PwnLab_init as it was the only vulnerable machine that I was able to get running properly. This was heavily due to network issues. There was also the HTB Lame where I was able to get both root and user access to the machine, this was through searching through different exploits till I found one that worked through a tool called metasploit. Other practtical ways to evoke my understanding were through overthewire challenges and doing writeups for these challenges gave me the opportunity to understand different concepts and methods of penetrating web applications. I attempted Pentester lab and other various soruces I could find to develop my skills and reinforce my understanding of web application and as a way for research.

Having the right mindset is significant for a cyber security professional in understanding the right approach in breaking or protecting a system. When jai presented the walkthrough of DeloPitte, he mention after using nmap to not use port 4949, rather do a proper nmap scan with 6000 ports as in real world applications there isn't a way to tell if p 4949 was open unless nmap properly. By having the correct mindset within the security field, when breaking into a box, the development of technical skills is important in actually finding vulnerabilites in field. This can also be accomplished when considering which tool should be used. The Boot2Root machine, understand how to break into it, setup a reverse shell, and achieving root access. When Darsh demonstrated his method of attacking a machine using various tools such as nmap. As these tools are designed for such attacks, attacking boxes on vul-hub and other machines

**SLO 3) Apply the Technical Skills to Develop, Model and Evaluate a Design** 

Applying technical skills to develop, model and evalutate a design by reseaching and understanding how vulnerabilities and exploits impact professionals to test and break into systems and web applications. Professionals understand how to mitigate a vulnerability usually after the vulnerability is exploited. Understanding the technical details in understanding how to detect flaws within a system or a web application gives time for developer to patch the vulnerability. This is shown through bug bounty program that was explored through week 2 where I had to disclosure a vulnerability after finding it. 

When presenting the RSA SecurID slides demonstrated the flaws, impacts of the breach started due to human error. This is fundamentally the reason for most attacks as for this scenario the attack were able to breach into the system through the use of phishing emails. Using an exploit of Adobe FLash with a zero-day attack exploit, to install a backdoor with the malicious tool poison ivy. The Remote Access Trojen allowed the attackers to achieve root access and steal credentials and other important informations from the servers. Through conducting research on this topic, I was able to understand how real attacks are utilising different small scale attacks such as XSS (Cross Site Scripting) and social engineering as one of the major ways for major attacks. This also taught me the technical details of what tools were used, how it happened and security measures that could be implemented for similar attacks. 

Understanding the important and the function of various tools, nmap, john the ripper, hashcat, medusa, hydra, etc. It is important that professionals understand the practical use for these tools and effectively use these tools to their advantage. When it come to cyber security, the practical environment to learn and skillfully exploit systems by finding vulnerabilitites. When focusing on tools such as burp suit and intercepting packets, changing cookies, just understand the basics of these tools and other tools such as hashcat that allows the attacker to set rules before an attack shows the effectiveness of developing the knowledge and skills to use such tools. 

Reversing a program in week 4 with reverse engineering was challenging as this was my first attempt to understand how to reverse engineering a program to capture a flag. Throughout the week, after being able to solve one of the challenges. It becomes interesting when considers where to insert the break point, how to use gdb (GNU debugger) and by checking areas where the program could be vulnerable. I believe it is important that security professional understand the functionality of systems and reverse engineering would provide better security for the system.

**SLO 4) Demonstrate Effective Collaboration and Communication Skills** 

The concept of teawork is a powerful skill involving contribution of ideas and situmlating throughts allows projects and tasks to be developed and completed. Professionals in the field require social involvement with other peers to project their knowledge and skills in a working environment. The necessar development of communication and collaboration within a group presents a multitude of motivation, methodologies and utilitse all their resources into completing a task. This was either through using online services annd various tools such as Messenger, Microsfot Teams, Google Docs, Google Slides to communicate each member, we gave each other roles that were designed to incooporate our strengths and weaknesses. There was google docs/google slides that was ultitised to give indications of work being completed by each member.

During group activities, utilising online services and talking amongst each other ensured communication and collaboration between each individual was established to utilise each of our strengths and weaknesses. The nature of most business models involved peers collaborating in groups to overcome challenges and to solve issues. This is established well in the cyber industry field as people tend to collaborate and communicate to solve challenges, hightlight their strengths through collaboration and communication.

When presenting to stakeholders, in this case students and tutos, working as part of a group to present on security topics gives the impression of cyber being a field where presenting in groups or just group work in general plays a significant roles is achieving success. This involved my presentation of RSA-SecurID breach, show vulnerabilities and Remote Access Trogen to the stakeholders simulating how security field industry presents issues and vulnerabilities to real world security profressionals/ stakholers. This was done again through showcasing various tools that were used to show the impacts and effects of the tools and how they impact the real world. We had to understand how important these tools were and evulated when each person would speak and what they had to do. 

The Expo, when I had to do a live demo of the HTB lame to other studio students highlights my involvement with communication to stakeholders and answering their questions on the how to the box was completed, what were tools, evaulating the impacts of the stakeholders to the studio through indivudal reseach, and showing the students where were completed during the past four weeks. 

Free-For-All sessions between the studio accomplished a better foothold of what everyone did during the weekends. These free-for-alls are giving each other information by getting into small groups and collaborating on what we have done, learnt and continue on doing as we learn from other sutdents and their experiences with either CTF, research, HTB challenges, pentester labs. Collaborating with both high level and technical details on how we solve problems and what we did when there was an obstacle gave us ways to explore options to overcome such obstacles.

**SLO 5) Conduct Critical Self, Peer Review and Performance Evaluation**

The significances of slef conduct, peer review and performacne evaluation highlights both my successes and mistakes throughout the subject. The important acentuation of effort by both studio students and I is further demonstrated through one-on-one sessions, free for alls and giving scrum speeches to the studio. Feedback by evaluating my personal goals and what I had achieved throughout the subject shows that I continuely acknowledge my mistakes and take further leaps in this industry. 

The one-on-one sessions where the tutors (Darsh / Larry) both gave constructive and informative feedback where details on what I did through the week, did I pass the subject, did I speak clearly, etc, ensured my improvement in embettering my personal growth to overcome these challenges.

Feedback through UTS Online further improved my understanding of my weaknesses and strengths in the subject. Moreover, this continued to improve my portflio, public speaking and my personal insight. Through the tutor's perspective of where I was in this subject and directed me to the right direction.
