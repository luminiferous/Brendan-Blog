**Conclusion**

To conclude, my main goal still hasn't been reached and there are still different techniques and methodologies in solving machines and CTFS. Through the past intensive but rewarding weeks of attempting the course through personal interest and as a goal of becoming a security professional, I definitely believed that I succeed in some aspects of my goals, completing a retired box and penetrating different machines and web applications. Researching exploits and common vulnerabilities and presenting them further enhanced and deepen my knowledge of the field, learning different methods of attacks identified how different approaches were used to tackle obstacles and industry presentations gave personal insight and engaging my thoughts to comprehend the sophisticated roles and the nature of the field I am about to undertake. The challenges and obstacles that I would undergo were public speaking issues that were present during my youth, but with encouragement and feedback from the tutors, I am currently attempting to further improve public speaking throughout my degree and towards the industry. Applying all my skills and knowledge in breaking into machines and finding vulnerabilities, targeting either active boxes and retired boxes from hack the box both encourage a stronger motivation in completing the subject and further using the tools and methodologies to be used professionally in the cyber field.

**Final Reflection**

Attempting the studio as an initial stepping stone to my involvement in the cyber field and applying my understanding to further elaborate on achieving my goals has both constraints my personal time and other subjects that were undertaken during the summer. However, through pursuing this career path I have learned and experience support by both peers and tutors to hopefully involve my interest in conducting my own personal time in further achieving completing more machine whilst both developing the skills and knowledge to continue cybersecurity. Furthermore, enveloping growth and skills in having the right mindset has further allowed my continuation of seeking pride in understanding techniques used in the industry. Throughout the Cyber Security Studio, I developed further knowledge of vulnerabilities in both web applications and machines, and hope to use this opportunity to engage with stakeholders in a refined and more respectable manner. Through the learning process throughout the Cyber Summer Studio Subject, I hope that I met all required SLOs needed to pass this subject.

**SLO 1) Engage with Stakeholders to Identify a Problem**

The concepts of cybersecurity to protect against malicious attacks, informing the fundamental concepts of security as presented throughout the subjects has provided a clear understanding of how security impacts business practices and stakeholders. Various visits of security professionals illustrated the building blocks by which the students in the studio get an understanding of how the field works as a whole. The introduction of industry professionals, Robert Mitchell provided the studio with a presentation of different methods of attack, firewalls and various other security topics based around the development of technology. Showing us through the problem with cloud services and their vulnerabilities, by which there are many targetable areas allows more risk for businesses such as Amazon that relies heavily on their cloud servers. Unlike firewalls which are easily defended, Robert Mitchell clearly explained the applications and the development of security as a whole. 

The problem with cybersecurity is its massive impacts when stakeholders are inflicted by attacks by hackers. This is represented by the RSA SecurID 60 million dollars lost when the security systems where breached. By research and studying vulnerabilities, I cam to a clear understanding of how security in the workforce operated and human error being a major impact for many businesses when uneducated on the importance of cybersecurity. Security professionals in cyber are required to have both skills and knowledge in testing a web application or a system, understand what can I exploit and find ways to exploits vulnerabilities that are found on a machine/ web application.

The sensation of presenting to tutors, explain the RSA breach and its effects when I gave my speech showed many of my flaws and weaknesses to the studio, when reflecting, engaging with stakeholders and understanding their thought process is essential in a business environment  in understanding how a security professional can interact to a stakeholder in terms they can understand.
When presenting the RSA SecurID breach to the studio, my attempt to give a high-level perspective with the effects and improves of the tool that was used during the attack also detailed my connection to stakeholders as I was engaging in a high level that makes it easier to people oblivious to cybersecurity. The significant in understanding how to present exploits and vulnerabilities to stakeholders in a way that encompasses the whole topic in a simplistic high-level point of view will give an easier way for the community to understand would prevent many attacks from happening due to human error.

The security mind as an ethical hacker and breaking into systems and web applications when being discussed with Luke Fuehrer, demonstrate the mindset of both a blue team hacker and a red team hacker, understanding the basics in approaches as in the metaphor with the foxes and the rabbits as a framework of security. When Luke explained what XXS (Cross Site Scripting) was he drove into problems that were present in most web applications and 3rd on OWASP, as one of the most used attacks. These are issues that security engineering faced on a daily basis and are required to further expand their understanding of the field when technology further advances.

**SLO 2) Apply Design Thinking To Respond To A Defined Or Newly Identified Problem**
When considering stakeholders, ensuring that a website and a system is secured in response to future attacks is important when considering vulnerabilities and exploits. With technology consistently improving and changing, it is important to ensure that the technical workings of security develop and continue to learn the outer and inner working of systems and web applications. Reflecting on the past 4 weeks, the various exploits and exploits learned is important for security professionals to understand and engage with a skillful accentuation of said understanding through breaking into vulnerable web applications and systems. By developing skills to respond to situations by using a cybersecurity mindset involves the professional to explore different solutions to solve the same problem. There are various ways for a security professional to be involved with taking advantage of security flaws and vulnerabilities through applying their knowledge of how the actual exploit functions.

Demonstrating the importance of cybersecurity to stakeholders to ensure that web applications and machines are properly secure and safe from any common risk and exploit. Focusing on both web application and attacking machines as I'm still quite new to the field, with my attempt on machines on hack the box both active and retired whilst doing writeups. This will further provide a better understanding of using drib (directory buster), Burp Suite, wget, netdiscover, and various other tools and improve my skills. Expanding on my current knowledge of cybersecurity, this subject has helped my development into the cybersecurity industry. By completing various Over the Wire challenges, both Natas and Bandits challenges empowered my knowledge and skills on how to use the Linux kernel and how to attack web applications. This led to consistent uses of performing XXS and SQL injections to locate vulnerabilities on machines.

When Luke discussing the details on the mindset of an ethical hacker, he distinctly said that nmap was a noisy tool and we should be careful when using it for an actual attack. This is notated by a hacker's mindset, the response of the attack to be undetected whilst attacking the correct ports of a system is important for stakeholders. This is demonstrated by various machines on Vul-Hub and Hack the Box when attackers attempt to gain root, a user can easily get root access when skilled and inject malicious malware or do any other malicious activities.

The machines I could practice were PwnLab_init as it was the only vulnerable machine that I was able to get running properly. This was heavily due to network issues. There was also the HTB Lame where I was able to get both root and user access to the machine, this was through searching through different exploits till I found one that worked through a tool called Metasploit. Other practical ways to evoke my understanding were through Overthewire challenges and doing writeups for these challenges gave me the opportunity to understand different concepts and methods of penetrating web applications. I attempted Pentester lab and other various sources I could find to develop my skills and reinforce my understanding of web application and as a way for research.

Having the right mindset is significant for a cybersecurity professional in understanding the right approach in breaking or protecting a system. When Jai presented the walkthrough of Deloitte, he mentions after using nmap to not use port 4949, rather does a proper Nmap scan with 6000 ports as in real-world applications there isn't a way to tell if p 4949 was open unless nmap properly. By having the correct mindset within the security field, when breaking into a box, the development of technical skills is important in actually finding vulnerabilities in the field. This can also be accomplished when considering which tool should be used. The Boot2Root machine, understand how to break into it, set up a reverse shell, and achieving root access. When Darsh demonstrated his method of attacking a machine using various tools such as Nmap. As these tools are designed for such attacks, attacking boxes on vul-hub and other machines

**SLO 3) Apply the Technical Skills to Develop, Model and Evaluate a Design** 

Applying technical skills to develop, model and evaluate a design by researching and understanding how vulnerabilities and exploits impact professionals to test and break into systems and web applications. Professionals understand how to mitigate a vulnerability usually after the vulnerability is exploited. Understanding the technical details in understanding how to detect flaws within a system or a web application gives time for developers to patch the vulnerability. This is shown through bug bounties program that was explored through week 2 where I had to disclose a vulnerability after finding it. 

When presenting the RSA SecurID slides demonstrated the flaws, impacts of the breach started due to human error. This is fundamentally the reason for most attacks as for this scenario the attack were able to breach into the system through the use of phishing emails. Using an exploit of Adobe Flash with a zero-day attack exploits, to install a backdoor with the malicious tool poison ivy. The Remote Access Trojan allowed the attackers to achieve root access and steal credentials and other important information from the servers. Through conducting research on this topic, I was able to understand how real attacks are utilising different small scale attacks such as XSS (Cross Site Scripting) and social engineering as one of the major ways for major attacks. This also taught me the technical details of what tools were used, how it happened and security measures that could be implemented for similar attacks. 

Understanding the importance and the function of various tools, nmap, john the ripper, hashcat, Medusa, Hydra, etc. It is important that professionals understand the practical use of these tools and effectively use these tools to their advantage. When it comes to cybersecurity, the practical environment to learn and skillfully exploit systems by finding vulnerabilities. When focusing on tools such as burp suit and intercepting packets, changing cookies, just understand the basics of these tools and other tools such as hashcat that allows the attacker to set rules before an attack shows the effectiveness of developing the knowledge and skills to use such tools. 

Reversing a program in week 4 with reverse engineering was challenging as this was my first attempt to understand how to reverse engineering a program to capture a flag. Throughout the week, after being able to solve one of the challenges. It becomes interesting when considers where to insert the breakpoint, how to use gdb (GNU debugger) and by checking areas where the program could be vulnerable. I believe it is important that security professionals understand the functionality of systems and reverse engineering would provide better security for the system.

**SLO 4) Demonstrate Effective Collaboration and Communication Skills** 

The concept of teamwork is a powerful skill involving the contribution of ideas and stimulating thoughts allows projects and tasks to be developed and completed. Professionals in the field require social involvement with other peers to project their knowledge and skills in a working environment. The necessary development of communication and collaboration within a group presents a multitude of motivation, methodologies and utilitse all their resources into completing a task. This was either through using online services and various tools such as Messenger, Microsoft Teams, Google Docs, Google Slides to communicate each member, we gave each other roles that were designed to incorporate our strengths and weaknesses. There were google docs/google slides that were utilised to give indications of work being completed by each member.

During group activities, utilising online services and talking amongst each other ensured communication and collaboration between each individual was established to utilise each of our strengths and weaknesses. The nature of most business models involved peers collaborating in groups to overcome challenges and to solve issues. This is established well in the cyber industry field as people tend to collaborate and communicate to solve challenges, highlight their strengths through collaboration and communication.

When presenting to stakeholders, in this case, students and tutors, working as part of a group to present on security topics give the impression of cyber being a field where presenting in groups or just group work in general plays a significant role in achieving success. This involved my presentation of RSA-SecurID breach, show vulnerabilities and Remote Access Trogen to the stakeholders simulating how security field industry presents issues and vulnerabilities to real-world security professionals/ stakeholders. This was done again by showcasing various tools that were used to show the impacts and effects of the tools and how they impact the real world. We had to understand how important these tools were and evaluated when each person would speak and what they had to do. 

The Expo, when I had to do a live demo of the HTB lame to other studio students highlights my involvement with communication to stakeholders and answering their questions on the how to the box was completed, what were tools, evaluating the impacts of the stakeholders to the studio through individual research, and showing the students where were completed during the past four weeks. 

Free-For-All sessions between the studio accomplished a better foothold of what everyone did during the weekends. These free-for-alls are giving each other information by getting into small groups and collaborating on what we have done, learned and continue on doing as we learn from other students and their experiences with either CTF, research, HTB challenges, pentester labs. Collaborating with both high level and technical details on how we solve problems and what we did when there was an obstacle gave us ways to explore options to overcome such obstacles.

**SLO 5) Conduct Critical Self, Peer Review and Performance Evaluation**

The significances of self-conduct, peer review and performance evaluation highlights both my successes and mistakes throughout the subject. The important accentuation of effort by both studio students and I is further demonstrated through one-on-one sessions, free for alls and giving scrum speeches to the studio. Feedback by evaluating my personal goals and what I had achieved throughout the subject shows that I continually acknowledge my mistakes and take further leaps in this industry. 

The one-on-one sessions where the tutors (Darsh / Larry) both gave constructive and informative feedback where details on what I did through the week, did I pass the subject, did I speak clearly, etc, ensured my improvement in bettering my personal growth to overcome these challenges.

Feedback through UTS Online further improved my understanding of my weaknesses and strengths in the subject. Moreover, this continued to improve my portfolio, public speaking and my personal insight. Through the tutor's perspective of where I was in this subject and directed me in the right direction.
