**Conclusion**

To conclude, my main goal still hasn't been reached and there are still different techniques and methodologies in solving machines and CTFS. Through the past intensive but rewarding weeks of attempting the course through perssonal interest and as a goal of becoming a security professional, I definietly believed that I suceed in some aspects of my goals, completing a retired box and penetrating different machines and web applications. Reseaching exploits and common vulnerabilities and presenting them further enhanced and deepen my knowledge of the field, learning different methods of attacks idenitified how different apporaches were used to tackle obstacles and industry presentations gave personal insight and engaging my throughts to comprehend the sophisticated roles and the nature of the field I am about to undertake. The challenges and obstacles that I would under

Reflecting on the past 4 weeks, the various exploits and exploits learn't is important for security professionals to understand and engage with a skillful accentuation of said understanding through breaking into vulnerable web applications and systems. By developing skills to respond to situations by using a cyber security mindset involves the professional to explore different solutions to solve the same problem.

**SLO 4) Demonstrate Effective Collaboration and COmmunication Skills** 
The concept of teawork is a powerful skill involving contribution of ideas and situmlating throughts allows projects and tasks to be developed and completed. Professionals in the field require social involvement with other peers to project their knowledge and skills in a working environment. The necessar development of communication and collaboration within a group presents a multitude of motivation, methodologies and utilitse all their resources into completing a task. 

During group activities, utilising online services and talking amongst each other ensured communication and collaboration between each individual was established to utilise each of our strengths and weaknesses.

**SLO 5) Conduct Critical Self, Peer Review and Performance Evaluation**

The significances of slef conduct, peer review and performacne evaluation highlights both my successes and mistakes throughout the subject. The important acentuation of effort by both studio students and I is further demonstrated through one-on-one sessions, free for alls and giving scrum speeches to the studio. Feedback by evaluating my personal goals and what I had achieved throughout the subject shows that I continuely acknowledge my mistakes and take further leaps in this industry. 

The one-on-one sessions where the tutors (Darsh / Larry) both gave constructive and informative feedback where details on what I did through the week, did I pass the subject, did I speak clearly, etc, ensured my improvement in 

Feedback through UTS Online further improved my understanding of my weaknesses and strengths in the subject. Moreover, this continued to improve my portflio, public speaking and my personal insight. Through the tutor's perspective of where I was in this subject and directed my
