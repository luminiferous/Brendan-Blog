**Conclusion**

To conclude, my main goal still hasn't been reached and there are still different techniques and methodologies in solving machines and CTFS. Through the past intensive but rewarding weeks of attempting the course through perssonal interest and as a goal of becoming a security professional, I definietly believed that I suceed in some aspects of my goals, completing a retired box and penetrating different machines and web applications. Reseaching exploits and common vulnerabilities and presenting them further enhanced and deepen my knowledge of the field, learning different methods of attacks idenitified how different apporaches were used to tackle obstacles and industry presentations gave personal insight and engaging my throughts to comprehend the sophisticated roles and the nature of the field I am about to undertake. The challenges and obstacles that I would undergo were public speaking issues that were present during my youth, but with encouragement and feedback from the tutors I am currently attempting to further improve public speaking throughout my degree and towards the industry. Applying all my skills and knowledge in braking into machines and finding vulnnerabilities, targeting either active boxes and retired boxes from hack the box both encourage a stronger motivation in completing the subject and further using the tools and methodologies to be used professionally in the cyber field.

**Final Reflection**

Attempting the studio as an inital stepping stone to my involvement in the cyber field and applying my understanding to further elaborate on achieving my goals has both constraint my personal time and other subjects that were undertaken during the summer. However, through pursuing this career path I have learnt and experience support by both peers and tutors to hopefull involve my interest in conducting my own personal time in further achiveing completing more machine whilist both developing the skills and knowledge to continue cyber security. Furthermore, enveloping growth and skills in having the right mindset has further allowed my continuation of seeking pride in understanding techniques used in the industry. Throughout the Cyber Security Studio, I developed further knowledge of vulnerabilities in both web applications and machines, and hope to use this opportunity to engage with stakeholders in a refined and more respectable manner. Through the learning process throughout the Cyber Summer Studio Subject, I hope that I met all required SLOs needed to pass this subject.

**SLO 2) Apply Design Thinking To Respond To A Defined Or Newly Identified Problem**

Reflecting on the past 4 weeks, the various exploits and exploits learn't is important for security professionals to understand and engage with a skillful accentuation of said understanding through breaking into vulnerable web applications and systems. By developing skills to respond to situations by using a cyber security mindset involves the professional to explore different solutions to solve the same problem. There are various ways for a security professional to be involved with taking advantage of security and to

By compeleting various Overthe Wire challenges, both Natas and Bandits challenges enpowered my knowledge and skills on how to use the linux kernel and how to attack web applications.

**SLO 4) Demonstrate Effective Collaboration and Communication Skills** 

The concept of teawork is a powerful skill involving contribution of ideas and situmlating throughts allows projects and tasks to be developed and completed. Professionals in the field require social involvement with other peers to project their knowledge and skills in a working environment. The necessar development of communication and collaboration within a group presents a multitude of motivation, methodologies and utilitse all their resources into completing a task. This was either through using online services annd various tools such as Messenger, Microsfot Teams, Google Docs, Google Slides to communicate each member, we gave each other roles that were designed to incooporate our strengths and weaknesses. There was google docs/google slides that was ultitised to give indications of work being completed by each member.

During group activities, utilising online services and talking amongst each other ensured communication and collaboration between each individual was established to utilise each of our strengths and weaknesses. The nature of most business models involved peers collaborating in groups to overcome challenges and to solve issues. This is established well in the cyber industry field as people tend to collaborate and communicate to solve challenges, hightlight their strengths through collaboration and communication.

When presenting to stakeholders, in this case students and tutos, working as part of a group to present on security topics gives the impression of cyber being a field where presenting in groups or just group work in general plays a significant roles is achieving success. This involved my presentation of RSA-SecurID breach, show vulnerabilities and Remote Access Trogen to the stakeholders simulating how security field industry presents issues and vulnerabilities to real world security profressionals/ stakholers. This was done again through showcasing various tools that were used to show the impacts and effects of the tools and how they impact the real world. We had to understand how important these tools were and evulated when each person would speak and what they had to do. 

The Expo, when I had to do a live demo of the HTB lame to other studio students highlights my involvement with communication to stakeholders and answering their questions on the how to the box was completed, what were tools, evaulating the impacts of the stakeholders to the studio through indivudal reseach, and showing the students where were completed during the past four weeks. 

Free-For-All sessions between the studio accomplished a better foothold of what everyone did during the weekends. These free-for-alls are giving each other information by getting into small groups and collaborating on what we have done, learnt and continue on doing as we learn from other sutdents and their experiences with either CTF, research, HTB challenges, pentester labs. Collaborating with both high level and technical details on how we solve problems and what we did when there was an obstacle gave us ways to explore options to overcome such obstacles.

**SLO 5) Conduct Critical Self, Peer Review and Performance Evaluation**

The significances of slef conduct, peer review and performacne evaluation highlights both my successes and mistakes throughout the subject. The important acentuation of effort by both studio students and I is further demonstrated through one-on-one sessions, free for alls and giving scrum speeches to the studio. Feedback by evaluating my personal goals and what I had achieved throughout the subject shows that I continuely acknowledge my mistakes and take further leaps in this industry. 

The one-on-one sessions where the tutors (Darsh / Larry) both gave constructive and informative feedback where details on what I did through the week, did I pass the subject, did I speak clearly, etc, ensured my improvement in embettering my personal growth to overcome these challenges.

Feedback through UTS Online further improved my understanding of my weaknesses and strengths in the subject. Moreover, this continued to improve my portflio, public speaking and my personal insight. Through the tutor's perspective of where I was in this subject and directed me to the right direction.
