I am currently a 2nd year engineering student studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering and majoring in software engineering. My currently interests are programming in java, C++, python and red team penetration testing on web applications and cyber security in general. With my experience at UTS, I recently participated in Cyber Security Challenge Australia as the first-year team 2018, UTS Hackathon "Code2Learn" 2018 and ProgComp 2018. I hope that this e-portfolio is on satisfactory to use as consolidate in future projects.
