I am currently a 2nd year engineering student studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering and majoring in software engineering. My currently interests are programming in java, C++, python and red team penetration testing on web applications and cyber security in general. With my experience at UTS, I recently participated in Cyber Security Challenge Australia as the first-year team 2018, UTS Hackathon "Code2Learn" 2018 and ProgComp 2018. I hope that this e-portfolio is on satisfactory to use as consolidate in future projects.

**The Start of the Studio**
- **Purpose**
I enjoy doing CTF challenges as a hobby and been hacking since the previous year, this has evoked my interest in chosing Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset Studio. Learning, growth and potential through this subject gives me the opporunity to enhance my skills and knowledge in development necessary in further advancing in the IT/Cyber Industry.


- **What I get from the Studio**
The results achieved from the Cyber Studio has align with my overall career path, advancing it and teaching me throughout the course to develop communication to stakeholders, understanding the important factors of communicaton, colaboration and teamwork as an essential aspect in developing personal insight.

Although I particated with other teamsmembers, I consider presentations, teamwork and collaboration as important aspects in the cyber field to both develop my skills and knowledge especially when considering information Technology. The opportunties gained from approaching this subject through studying and practicing upon my presentation and teamwork has overall developed my understanding and gave clarity to my goals that are incorporated with my interest to the Cyber field.
